Analyze the following market data for {pair} and provide a JSON object with the keys: 'signal_type', 'moving_average', and 'technical_indicators'. For example: {{'signal_type': 'Buy', 'moving_average': 'Neutral', 'technical_indicators': 'Sell'}}. If market potential is high then use Strong Buy or Buy. If market potential is low then use Strong Sell or Sell. If technical_indicators and moving_average are in buy/strong buy direction then don't ever give signal_type in Sell/strong sell direction and same vice versa. If moving_average and technical_indicators are in Neutral then signal_type type will also be Neutral. Here is the data: {market_data}. Don't give unnecessary information. Just provide the JSON object.
