Analyze the following market data for {pair} and return a concise JSON object with the following keys: 'signal_type', 'moving_average', and 'technical_indicators'. For example: {{"signal_type": "Buy", "moving_average": "Neutral", "technical_indicators": "Sell"}}. Always return data in this exact format.

If both 'moving_average' and 'technical_indicators' are aligned (both Buy/Strong Buy or both Sell/Strong Sell), ensure 'signal_type' is in the same direction.
If 'moving_average' and 'technical_indicators' are opposite, choose the stronger side.
If both are Neutral, set 'signal_type' to Neutral.
Never give a 'signal_type' of Sell/Strong Sell if both indicators suggest Buy/Strong Buy, and vice versa.
Use 'Strong Buy' or 'Strong Sell' if market potential is high, and 'Buy' or 'Sell' if potential is lower.
Ensure the probabilities are distributed as follows:

Around 0.4 probability for Buy/Strong Buy and Sell/Strong Sell.
Around 0.2 probability for Neutral.
